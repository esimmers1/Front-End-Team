# Front-End-Team
3/3: Demo
      - basic website interoperability and structure to build off of for the rest of this project.
      - We have several pages:
        1)  Home
        2)  Contact
        3)  About
        4)  Search
        5)  History
      - These will be basic webpages, with information showing that they are unique pages.
      - This is the base case we will be working on for the project.
      - Action Items: 
        1)  Data handling on each page 
        2)  Look at possible web tech. to integrate to the website (Bootsrtap, APIs, etc...).
        3)  Begin to look to connect a database
